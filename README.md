# A live graph

### Python , matplotlib, threads

## Description

a nice project for creating a live graph in matplotlib module.

The program runs in 2 threads, so one of them runs the matplotlib and the other runs a random x,y script to a text file.

At the time of the run you will get a graph reloaded in each 1 second, I use an animation of matplotlib to load the function to display the graph every second. The function reads and displays the data.

Running the second trade adds random data to the file. You can undo it and write your own data file yourself and save its name. And you'll see the moving graph


Installing required packages

```python
pip install matplotlib
```

___

The program run will give you the following image:

<div  width=100%>
<img src="https://profile.fcdn.co.il/images2/0__05b05b4c4ee68c.jpg" width="500" style="padding:1px;
                   border:1px solid #021a40; 
                  display: block;
                  margin-left: auto;
                  margin-right: auto "> 
</div>


Enjoy...
